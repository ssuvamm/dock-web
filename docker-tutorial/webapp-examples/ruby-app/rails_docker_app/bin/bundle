# This file is a wrapper for the `bundle` command.
# It is recommended to run `bundle binstubs bundler` to generate this file.
#
# If you have a Bundler binstub, it would typically load Bundler.
# For simplicity in manual creation for this Docker example,
# we'll rely on `bundle exec` in our commands, so this specific binstub
# is less critical if `bundle install --binstubs` or `bundle binstubs`
# was not run.
#
# However, to make it somewhat functional if called:
ENV['BUNDLE_GEMFILE'] ||= File.expand_path('../Gemfile', __dir__)
require 'bundler/setup' # Set up the load paths
load Gem.bin_path('bundler', 'bundle')
